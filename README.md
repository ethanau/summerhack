# IELTS Frequency Words Study Engine
## Description
This program is an IELTS Frequency Words Study Engine that runs on a personal computer and is designed for people preparing for the IELTS exam, but can also be used to prepare for other language exams by customizing the vocabulary database. IELTS and other language exams have been a necessary process for students and some working professionals during their school career, and vocabulary is the foundation. This IELTS Frequency Words Study Engine solves the problem of inefficient memorization and the inability to customize vocabulary databases by studying for 15 minutes at a time and separating mastered and unmastered vocabulary for efficient memorization, and allowing the user to customize the vocabulary database.<br>
